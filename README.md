# CC
CC app is the solution to encouraging more people to take public transport for their everyday commute. Commuters will scan QR codes placed on public transport vehicles and earn an internal currency called Leaves. Commuters will be able to spend these Leaves on discount voucher offered by local retailers. 

To further encourage usage of the system, there is a competitive aspect and gamification. Commuters have avatars they unlock by riding public transport and can buy additional ones with Leaves that they save up if they wish. There is a leaderboard between friends, local area and cities as a whole. 

The final implementation would have WeChat integration for friends and login. 

Language support for Chinese (Mandarin) and English.
